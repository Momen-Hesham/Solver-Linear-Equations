## Solver-Linear-Equations

# Description
This project is used to solve Linear Equations up to 100 Equations with up to 100 variables.
it also has many Operations like:
* num_vars 
which prints the number of variables.
* equation i
which print the equztion number (i).
* column var
which prints the column of coefficients of variable (var).
* add 1 3
which adds equations 1 & 3 and prints the result.
* subtract 1 3
which subtracts equations 1 & 3 and prints the result.
* Substitude var 1 3
which substitutes the variable (var0 in equation 1 by its equation got by equation 3 and prints the result.
* D 
which Prints the Cramer's cofficients matrix.
* D var 
which Prints the Cramer's cofficients matrix of variable (var).
* D_value
which Prints the Cramer's cofficients matrix determinant value.
* solve
which prints the solution of the equations.
